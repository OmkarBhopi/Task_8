This project is part of the SQL Developer Internship

Task 8: Stored Procedures and Functions.
I used pgAdmin 4 to create reusable SQL blocks using stored procedures and functions.

In this task, I:

Created at least one stored procedure to perform a specific operation using input parameters

Created a user-defined function that returns a value based on logic and parameters

Used SQL features like IN, OUT, RETURN, and conditional checks


This task helped me understand the difference between procedures and functions, how to modularize logic, and how to call reusable blocks for database operations.

The project includes:

A .sql file with the procedure and function definitions and Screenshots of execution outputs from pgAdmin 4
